#
# This file defines a polygon pattern in meters, with the drifter at the origin.
#
# The syntax is a YAML file
#
# normalization is an overall scaling factor to multiply polygon vertices by
# rotation_angle is an angle to rotate the pattern about the origin by in degrees
# qRotate is a boolean, true or false, if the pattern is to be rotated so
#         +x is in the same direction as the drifter's velocity vector
#
# polygon is an array of points, [x,y], in meters
#
# Each line is a corner of the polygon. The last point is closed to the first.
# When the glider surfaces it will fly to the closest point in time in the
# pattern then continue in the order sequenced.
#
# Slocum's have a maximum of 7 waypoints, so the polygon will be limited to 7
# vertices
#
# A butterfly pattern

normalization: 1000 # multiply all points by this value, 1m->1km
rotation_angle: 45 # Rotate pattern by this many degrees in the Cartesian plane
qRotate: true # Rotate the pattern along the drifter's velocity vector,
                 # +x in the cartesian plan is parallel to the velocity vector
polygon:
 # x, y
 - [ 1, 1] # northeast point
 - [-1,-1] # southwest point
 - [-1, 1] # northwest point
 - [ 1,-1] # southeast point

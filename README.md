# For a drifter and a glider, calculate a set of waypoints in the drifter's moving frame

We will be receiving drifter GPS fixes periodically.
When the glider surfaces, get its GPS fix and depth averaged current.
Given a predefined pattern, calculate a set of waypoints in the drifter's moving reference frame.
